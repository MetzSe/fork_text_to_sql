# Contributing Guidelines

## Overview

This repository contains research code supporting our published work on patient cohort generation and epidemiological question answering. While we welcome community engagement, please note that this is primarily a research publication repository rather than an actively developed open-source project.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

  - Clear description of the problem
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected vs. actual behavior
  - Your environment (Python version, OS, etc.)

- **Questions**: For questions about the research methods, implementation details, or paper clarifications, feel free to open an issue.

### Suggesting Improvements

We welcome suggestions for:
- Code clarity improvements
- Documentation enhancements
- Example code fixes
- Performance optimizations

Please open an issue first to discuss significant changes before implementing them.
